## **Test Neomind**

## **Challenge Logic and Programming**
- Objective:
    - The objective of this challenge is to demonstrate your skill and knowledge in programming logic. That way we'll know how you think.
- The Problem:
    - Write a program where, given a given time, it is able to
calculate the angle between the 2 hands of the clock.
    - Premise:
        1. Consider:
            - 00:00h has an angle of 0°
            - 00:15h has an angle of 90°
            - 00:30 h has an angle of 180°
        2. Method signature:
            - int retornaAnguloRelogio (int hora, int minuto);
        3. The challenge must be solved by writing in Java or natural language.
        4. If you have any doubts, make the decision that you think is the best.
    - Reply:
        ```` 
        Public int retornaAnguloRelogio (int hora, int minuto) { 
            // Implement the rest of the method
        }
        ````
